"Real vs. Fake
Purpose is to identify whether people are concerned if things are real or not and what impact the outcome may play. Obviously, in the diamond story, Emma will get ripped off financially if she purchases a fake diamond. A real consequence. But does it really matter if the house is fake or not? Only to the people who were living in the real houses, not in the context of this story. It also matters, from a research point of view whether the animal seen was a squirrel or not. Another real consequence.","q_fg64rd_R_22G14yDL5Jhib8o","eng"
